# Pivot function names

On 2019-03-22, I [tweeted
about](https://twitter.com/hadleywickham/status/1109132826631421952) a
[survey](https://forms.gle/vvYgBw1EwHK69gA17) to help me pick names for
the [new pivot
functions](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/dev/articles/pivot.html) in the
dev version of tidyr.

In the survey, I showed a picture of two tables containing the same
data, and asked participants to describe their relative shapes. This
document describes the results.

![Table A has four columns (id, x, y, z) and 2 rows. Table B has three
columns (id, n, x) and six rows](table.png)

``` r

# This googlesheet is public if you want to do your own analysis
key <- gs_key("1Do5R1k5sEZrwU0N1KmIjKaapHDrf7eYLdIlcGNx-MsI")
results <- googlesheets::gs_read(key, col_types = list())
names(results) <- c("timestamp", "table_a", "table_b")
head(results)

## Table A -\> Table B

Wider is the clear winner with ~80% of responses.

``` r
table_a <- results %>% 
  filter(!is.na(table_a)) %>% 
  mutate(top3 = table_a %>% fct_lump(3) %>% fct_infreq() %>% fct_rev()) %>%
  count(top3) %>% 
  mutate(prop = n / sum(n))

table_a %>% 
  ggplot(aes(top3, prop)) +
  geom_col() +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +
  labs(
    x = NULL,
    y = "Percent of responses"
  ) + 
  coord_flip()
```

There were a wide range of write in respones. The most popular included
concise, compact, condense, denser.

## Table B -\> Table A

Longer is the clear winner with ~70% of responses. Given the number of
people who suggested taller to me, I had expected it to come in much
higher. Interestingly narrower is much less common than shorter, it’s
equivalent above.

``` r
table_b <- results %>% 
  filter(!is.na(table_b)) %>% 
  mutate(top3 = table_b %>% fct_lump(3) %>% fct_infreq() %>% fct_rev()) %>%
  count(top3) %>% 
  mutate(prop = n / sum(n))

table_b %>% 
  ggplot(aes(top3, prop)) +
  geom_col() +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +
  labs(
    x = NULL,
    y = "Percent of responses"
  ) + 
  coord_flip()
```

## Conclusion

The new functions will be called `pivot_wider()` and `pivot_longer()`:
these are not the most natural names for everyone, but they are the
most popular by a large margin. I like pivot because it suggests the
form of the underlying operation (a pivoting or rotation), and it is
evocative to excel users.

A few alternatives that were suggested, considered, and rejected:

  - `VERB_long()`/`VERB_wide()`: not obvious whether they take long/wide
    data or return long/wide data.

  - `VERB_to_long()`/`VERB_to_wider()`: implies that long and wide are
    absolute terms. I don’t think it makes sense to talk about long or
    wide form data; you can only say one form is longer or wider than
    another form.

  - `to_long()`/`to_wide()`: isn’t a verb, and implies that there’s only
    one operation that makes data longer/wider. The next version of
    tidyr will also contain functions that unnest list-columns of
    vectors, and that verb (name TBA) also needs directional suffixes.

  - `reshape_SHAPE`: too much potential for confusion with the existing
    `base::reshape()`

  - `gather()`/`spread()`: while some people clearly liked these
    functions they were not memorable to a large number of people I
    talked to.

I appreciate the enthusiasm that people have for naming functions\!
