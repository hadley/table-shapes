# Pivot function names

On 2019-03-22, I [tweeted about](https://twitter.com/hadleywickham/status/1109132826631421952) a [survey](https://forms.gle/vvYgBw1EwHK69gA17) to help me pick names for the [new pivot functions](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/dev/articles/pivot.html) in the dev version of tidyr.

In the survey, I showed a picture of two tables containing the same data, and asked participants to describe their relative shapes. This document describes the results. 

![Table A has four columns (id, x, y, z) and 2 rows. Table B has three columns (id, n, x) and six rows](table.png)

```{r, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(comment = "#>", collapse = TRUE)
```

```{r setup, message = FALSE}
library(googlesheets)
library(tidyverse)

# This googlesheet is public if you want to do your own analysis
key <- gs_key("1Do5R1k5sEZrwU0N1KmIjKaapHDrf7eYLdIlcGNx-MsI")
results <- googlesheets::gs_read(key, col_types = list())
names(results) <- c("timestamp", "table_a", "table_b")
head(results)

nrow(results)

# Capture for posterity
write_csv(results, "results.csv")
```

## Table A -> Table B

Wider is the clear winner with ~80% of responses.

```{r}
table_a <- results %>% 
  filter(!is.na(table_a)) %>% 
  mutate(top3 = table_a %>% fct_lump(3) %>% fct_infreq() %>% fct_rev()) %>%
  count(top3) %>% 
  mutate(prop = n / sum(n))

table_a %>% 
  ggplot(aes(top3, prop)) +
  geom_col() +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +
  labs(
    x = NULL,
    y = "Percent of responses"
  ) + 
  coord_flip()
```

There were a wide range of write in respones. The most popular included concise, compact, condense, denser.

```{r}
results %>% 
  mutate(
    table_a = table_a %>% 
      str_remove("Table A is ") %>% 
      str_remove(" than Table B") %>% 
      str_trunc(50)
  ) %>% 
  count(table_a, sort = TRUE) %>% 
  print(n = Inf)
```

## Table B -> Table A

Longer is the clear winner with ~70% of responses. Given the number of people who suggested taller to me, I had expected it to come in much higher. Interestingly narrower is much less common than shorter, it's equivalent above.

```{r}
table_b <- results %>% 
  filter(!is.na(table_b)) %>% 
  mutate(top3 = table_b %>% fct_lump(3) %>% fct_infreq() %>% fct_rev()) %>%
  count(top3) %>% 
  mutate(prop = n / sum(n))

table_b %>% 
  ggplot(aes(top3, prop)) +
  geom_col() +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +
  labs(
    x = NULL,
    y = "Percent of responses"
  ) + 
  coord_flip()
```

There were a wide range of write in respones. The most popular included expanded and skinnier.

```{r}
results %>% 
  mutate(
    table_b = table_b %>% 
      str_remove("Table B is ") %>% 
      str_remove(" than Table A") %>% 
      str_trunc(50)
  ) %>% 
  count(table_b, sort = TRUE) %>% 
  print(n = Inf)
```

## Conclusion

The new functions will be called `pivot_wider()` and `pivot_longer()`: these are not the most natural names for everyone, but they are are the most popular by a large margin. I like pivot because it suggests the form of the underlying operation (a pivoting or rotation), and it is evocative to excel users.

A few alternatives that were suggested, considered, and rejected:

* `VERB_long()`/`VERB_wide()`: not obvious whether they take long/wide
  data or return long/wide data.
  
* `VERB_to_long()`/`VERB_to_wider()`: implies that long and wide are absolute
  terms. I don't think it makes sense to talk about long or wide form data;
  you can only say one form is longer or wider than another form.
  
* `to_long()`/`to_wide()`: isn't a verb, and implies that there's only one 
  operation that makes data longer/wider. The next version of tidyr will also
  contain functions that unnest list-columns of vectors, and that verb (name 
  TBA) also needs directional suffixes.
  
* `reshape_SHAPE`: too much potential for confusion with the existing 
  `stats::reshape()`

* `gather()`/`spread()`: while some people clearly liked these functions they
  were not memorable to a large number of people I talked to. 

I appreciate the enthusiasm that people have for naming functions!
